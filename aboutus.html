        <img src="images/aboutus_main.jpg" alt="About Us – Main | NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger" height="290px">
        <p>NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger began with simple annual Christmas food donations to people on the streets of Davao City by a group of Filipino high school students. After two years since the beginning of their tradition, the group decided to upgrade from once-a-year gifts of homemade food packages to bigger operations, such as regular food drives. With that, they established NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger, promoting Zero Hunger online and starting up community outreaches.<br><br>By the time the founding members graduated from high school, NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger had attained traction nationwide, gaining a number of sponsors.The organization was able to expand and reach out farther with its extended resources and capability. Up to the present day, NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger remains an organization built on compassion and humanity, continuously striving to become better for the sake of the world.</p>

        <p>As an actively concerned individual, NoughtHungry: for Zero Hunger is one of the accomplishments in my life that I am most proud of. I have achieved many things, having been a scholar of Philippine Science High School and being a graduate of the Harvard chemistry program, but being able to live speaking up for and acting on a cause I have been looking out for since childhood outshines all of them. I am Aneesa Fareedah B. Biruar, the first founder of NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger, and I aspire to make an impact for the better of the world.<br><br>Let us work together toward a better future, a better world, free of hunger and full of security.</p>
