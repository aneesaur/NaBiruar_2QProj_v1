                <p>In the Philippines, hunger has been a persisting major issue for a long period of time. <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048156/sws-hunger-rate-at-27-2-highest-since-pandemic">A report in March 2025</a> presented survey-based facts that 27.2% of Filipino families or 7.5 million households were recently faced with hunger <a href="https://www.globalhungerindex.org/">(Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2025)</a>, not counting the actual number of individuals affected. The Philippines has been consistently ranked among the top most food insecure countries in Southeast Asia <a href="https://borgenproject.org/update-on-hunger-in-the-philippines/">(Steventon, 2023)</a>.</p>

                <summary>Taken Initiatives</summary>
                <p>To deal with the problem of hunger, a number of organizations have been established as global support. The <a href="https://www.wfp.org/">World Food Programme</a> is dedicated to food provision, delivering emergency relief to hunger-afflicted countries, and takes part in the development of agriculture. The <a href="https://www.fao.org/home/en/">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> of the United Nations is a specialized agency under the United Nations, similar to the World Food Programme, that works toward food security globally. The list of institutions that are for the same cause goes on and on, all with their own unique systems and services and all looking forward to a future free of hunger.</p>

                <summary>Significance of Understanding</summary>
                <p>It is important to understand hunger because it is not just the issue of one person or one country, but of the world. Hunger is caused by a multitude of factors, a number of which we created and continue to create for ourselves. Therefore, we must all take responsibility for our actions and do what we can to promote food security and eradicate hunger.</p>

        <img src="images/home_sdg2.jpg" alt="Home – Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger | NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger" height="100px">
        <p>In 2015, the United Nations established the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a>, to be integrated with the 2030 Agenda that aims for global peace and prosperity. Among them, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2">Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger</a> stands as the appeal to end world hunger. As we move closer to 2030, Zero Hunger is unfortunately still far away from truly being reached, but let us not lose hope. Let this be a reminder of what we are fighting for, a hard push toward the future that we want to build for the world.</p>
