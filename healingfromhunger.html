        <p>Although hunger has struck the world in disastrous ways, it has not won yet. While we have a long way to go before achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, we have a long period of time left to do what we can to resolve the issue before it is too late. Such is why it is important that we know how we can prevent hunger as well as how to treat it as it is, even as a single individual. We must know this in order to be able to provide our own support to the cause to continue reaching it out to each place in the world. Furthermore, it is also effective to learn about related initiatives, for we can find ways to reimplement this with our own capabilities and discover more of how we can help.</p>

                <p>One simple but effective way of supporting the cause as a regular individual is making donations to groups and/or organizations that target Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. This can be applied among a wide range; local to international, digital to analog, and more. While it is a small step, it is guaranteed aid to the cause as it helps ensure the finance and/or supply of assisting operations.</p>

This can also be in the form of packaging emergency food supplies for the community of an individual to prepare for possible events, with proper care.</p>

                <p>According to <a href="https://wfpusa.org/news/how-to-end-world-hunger-6-zero-hunger-solutions/">World Food Program USA (2022)</a>, to attain zero hunger, it is crucial that we support the agricultural industry. For several reasons, such as inequity and emergency, farmers struggle socially and economically, thus work can be challenging for them. Despite this, farmers are the backbone of food production, nurturing crops and harvesting them for our benefit all year-round and their role in the world should not be undermined but appreciated.</p>

Understanding the labels on the food one buys and preventing food waste through various ways are efficient in keeping oneself safe from hunger. For Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger to be achieved, every individual must be counted for, including oneself.</p>

            <h2>Recommended Practices</h2>
            <p>There are several different practices that can be applied to battle hunger, ranging from small-scale to large-scale. To engage oneself deeper and find a sustainable method of participating in the journey toward Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, it is important to explore different avenues and open oneself to opportunities. NoughtHungry: For Zero Hunger recommends the promotion and implementation of three methods, two of which can be replicated easily by a regular individual and one which requires more tools and technique, but may still be viable for someone with more resources.</p>

                    <summary>Securing emergency response food</summary>
                    <p>In preparation for emergencies, one must secure a safe food supply to keep themselves from starvation. This can also be done as a community to ensure the collective safety of everyone during and after disasters. It is important that the food being kept is regularly monitored to ensure that it does not waste or expire by the time disaster strikes.</p>

                    <p>Certain foods can benefit the growth of plants with their nutrients. Using uneaten food as buffers for plant growth by adding them to soil is a practice that tackles food insecurity in two ways: Preventing food waste and supporting food production. This is a simple practice that can be of great help.</p>

                    <p>According to <a href="https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/story/climate-smart-agriculture-for-a-hunger-free-future/">Action Against Hunger (2025)</a>, climate-smart agriculture is a practice that creates one solution for climate change and food insecurity. Today, climate change is a major proponent that enforces several issues including hunger, for it can easily destroy food production with unprecedented weather. With climate-smart agriculture however, people adapt to climate change through adjusting their agricultural strategies to present weather conditions, including the type of crops grown so that food production is maximized.</p>
