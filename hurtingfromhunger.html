            <p>Hunger can greatly devastate lives in several different ways, scaling from individuals up to the entire world. It influences our living conditions, alongside the factors that cause it to occur, and can simply take our lives away. Such is why it is important to understand the whys and hows of hunger; with that knowledge, we are able to take appropriate measures for prevention and treatment, finding ways for ourselves to sympathize with and support others in need. Having in mind the causes as well, we are able to identify more solutions to more problems, contributing to a greater difference.</p>

                            <p>According to <a href="https://www.actionagainsthunger.org/the-hunger-crisis/the-causes-of-hunger/inequity/">Action Against Hunger (n.d.)</a>, it is those who are in power that determine the equity of society, including the distribution of food. In our society unfortunately, corruption and inequity is a common trait among our leaders, leading to unequal access to opportunities and resources, raising hunger rates. The reasons for inequity include bias and discrimination in sex, race, and other social attributes.</p>

These are caused by disputes over resources and land, for which people go to great lengths to claim, ignorant of cruelty. In the process, they limit food sources by forcing flees, delaying deliveries, and ruining crops. Because of this, hunger among the people increases greatly.</p>

Droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events greatly affect livelihoods, decreasing food availability. Additionally, they also have an impact on water supply.</p>

Such resources include food, raising hunger rates in naturally devastated communities. This happens alongside other issues caused by post-disaster resource scarcity, adding on to the situation.</p>

Reduced glucose intake can cause stress and depression, which if constant can cause an enduring problem. Continuous situations of hunger can also cause disorders related to post-traumatic stress disorder, which can persist even after coming out of food insecurity.</p>

Where many individuals are unable to work due to illness, the collective capability of a community decreases as there are less people who can manage it. The treatments needed for these illnesses could also cause a rise in healthcare costs, especially at a greater quantity, decreasing affordability.</p>

To compensate and provide for itself, the body will begin to burn glucose for energy and then fat when glucose runs out, which is when energy levels begin to drop. Once fat runs out, the body will use muscle and protein, until those run out too and the body breaks down its own organs, which can do more to itself than just damage.</p>

                            <p>According to <a href="https://www.welthungerhilfe.org/hunger">Welt Hunger Hilfe (n.d.)</a>, chronic hunger and malnutrition can not only delay development but also stop it completely. Nutrient deficiencies can lead to serious permanent effects such as incapacity of the body of an individual to develop, whether physically or mentally. This can also eventually affect a community, where individual efficiency would decrease and thus cause collective inadequacy.</p>

                    <p class="purple">According to <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/myanmar-brink-conflict-fuels-hunger">World Food Programme (2025)</a>, from 13.3 million people in 2024, 15 million people in Myanmar are to contemplate hunger in 2025. The current civil war conflict in Myanmar beginning in 2021 has continued to increase the rate of food insecurity and hunger, with rising inflation making basic staples unaffordable. Undoubtedly, residents of areas of active conflict are facing the issue at the frontmost line.</p>
                    <p class="white">According to <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/11/1166456">Mishra (2025)</a>, due to climate change and decreased rainfall, Somalia faces drought in 2025, leading to decreased harvests and increased food insecurity. With a total of 4 failed rainy seasons having passed by Somalia, water supply has inevitably become scarce as well, malnutrition becoming a trend in the country. Even the aid they had received was not enough and Somalia continues to struggle to support its people.</p>
                    <p class="purple">According to <a href="https://www.wfp.org/emergencies/sudan">World Food Programme (2025)</a>, as of 2025, in twenty areas across Greater Darfur and Greater Kordofan, famine is at risk and in Al Fasher and Kadugli, famine has been declared. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, 45% of the Sudanese population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity; by February 2026, hunger is expected to worsen further. While humanitarian aid and market recovery is now accessible in areas with no conflict, improvements are far from achieving wide-scale impact.</p>

In 2024, a survey showed that one of the main causes of food insecurity is the rising pricing of food in the country. 29% of Filipino children continue to face stunted growth as malnutrition remains constant in the country.</p>
                    <p class="purple">According to <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2048156/sws-hunger-rate-at-27-2-highest-since-pandemic">Philippine Daily Inquirer (2025)</a>, in the Philippines, 27.2% of Filipino families or 7.5 million households were faced with involuntary hunger in March 2025 based on a national survey by Social Weather Stations (SWS) and Stratbase. Since September 2020, this is one of the highest national hunger rates the country has seen. Additionally, from January to February, the hunger rate rose from 15.9% to 21.2%, a concerningly fast increase.</p>
                    <p class="white">According to <a href="https://borgenproject.org/update-on-hunger-in-the-philippines/">Steventon (2023)</a>, consistently, the Philippines has been ranked among the top most food insecure countries in Southeast Asia. A World Food Programme (WFP) survey shows that 1 in 10 Filipino households face food insecurity. In the Philippines, some of the driving forces of this are weather circumstances, economic inequality, and social inequality.</p>
